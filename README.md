# This is a TinyWebServer
## Note
- This server is running on the Linux.(I wrote them on Ubuntu).
- Using g++ 4.8.2
- Compile them separately into two executables called Server and Client, and you should run the client and server
on separate hosts on the internet. Start the server first.
    - In client terminal command line is : `./Client [your server's host name] [port number]`
    - In server terminal command line is : `./Server [port number]`
- If any bug caught, please [let me know](https://github.com/Soyn/TinyWebServer/issues), thanks.
